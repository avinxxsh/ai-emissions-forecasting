# Sustainable AI Emissions Forecasting & Green Cloud Analysis
By Avinaash Devasena Ganesh
(Data Science | Sustainable Technology | Responsible AI)

This project explores the environmental impact of AI and cloud workloads using hardware lifecycle emissions, energy consumption data, and grid-level electricity demand.
Using the Boavizta Environmental Footprint dataset and Our World In Data (OWID) Electricity Demand dataset, I analyzed:
Lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of datacenter hardware
Manufacturing vs. use-phase carbon contributions
Annual energy use per server
5-year emissions forecast for AI workloads
Electricity demand of a hypothetical 10-million-server cloud provider
Comparison of cloud energy demand to Europe’s electricity grid

The final outcome includes insights, visualizations, forecasting models, and high-impact sustainability recommendations for AI/Cloud companies.
